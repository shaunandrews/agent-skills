## Discovery: rjs/shaping-skills

**URL:** https://github.com/rjs/shaping-skills
**Author:** rjs (Ryan Singer — likely the Basecamp/Shape Up author)
**Description:** "Skills I use with Claude for shaping"

### What It Is
A repo containing two Claude skills for collaborative product shaping:

1. **shaping** — Structured methodology for defining problems (Requirements) and exploring solution options (Shapes)
2. **breadboarding** — Transforms workflows into affordance tables mapping UI and Code interactions

### Shaping Skill — Key Concepts

**Core model:** Requirements (R) × Shapes (S) → Fit Check
- **R (Requirements):** Numbered constraints defining the problem space (R0, R1, R2...)
- **S (Shapes):** Lettered solution approaches (A, B, C...) with components (C1, C2...) and alternatives (C3-A, C3-B...)
- **Fit Check:** Binary decision matrix (✅/❌) comparing all shapes against all requirements

**Document Hierarchy (multi-level consistency):**
1. Big Picture — quick context, highest level
2. Shaping doc — ground truth for R's, shapes, fit checks
3. Slices doc — ground truth for slice definitions
4. Individual slice plans — implementation details

Changes ripple both up and down the hierarchy. All levels must stay in sync.

**Two phases:**
1. **Shaping** → Explore problem/solution space, select a shape
2. **Slicing** → Break down into vertical slices for implementation

**Flagged Unknowns (⚠️):** Parts where we know WHAT but not HOW. These automatically fail fit checks because "you can't claim what you don't know."

**Key actions:** Populate R, Sketch shapes, Detail components, Check fit, Extract Rs, Breadboard, Spike (investigate unknowns), Slice

### Breadboarding Skill — Key Concepts

**Core model:** Places → Affordances → Wiring
- **Places:** Bounded contexts of interaction (modal = new place, dropdown = same place)
- **Affordances:** UI elements and code interfaces, numbered and cataloged
- **Wiring:** How affordances connect (Wires Out → Returns To)

Two use cases:
1. **Map existing system** — understand how something currently works
2. **Design from shaped parts** — detail new mechanisms

Tables are the source of truth; Mermaid diagrams are optional visualizations.

### Relevance to Agent Skills

**Skill design patterns:**
- Uses YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) for skill metadata
- Skills reference each other (`/breadboarding` invoked from shaping)
- Heavy use of tables and structured notation for collaborative work
- Skills encode a methodology, not just tool instructions

**For our skill ecosystem:**
- This is an excellent example of a "thinking methodology" skill vs. a "tool wrapper" skill
- The shaping approach could be packaged as a skill in our marketplace (clawhub.com)
- The document hierarchy concept (Big Picture → Shaping → Slices → Plans) is a pattern we could adopt for complex project planning
- The fit check matrix is a clean decision-making framework any agent could use

**For BYO Agents:**
- Demonstrates how skills can encode expert methodologies (Shape Up) for non-experts
- An agent with this skill essentially gets Ryan Singer's product thinking as a capability
- This is the "skills as superpowers" pitch — domain expertise packaged as agent capability
