## New Skill: headless-browser

Added `skills/headless-browser/` — invisible web browsing via Dockerized Chromium.

**Problem:** Bond using the browser tool would hijack Shaun's screen during research tasks.

**Solution:** Browserless v2 (`ghcr.io/browserless/chromium`) running in Docker with ARM64-native support for Apple Silicon. Fully headless — no windows, no focus stealing.

**Files:**
- `SKILL.md` — Agent instructions with security-first approach
- `README.md` — Human-facing documentation
- `scripts/ensure-running.sh` — Docker container lifecycle management
- `scripts/browse.sh` — CLI wrapper for screenshot/content/pdf with security boundaries

**Security:**
- All text content wrapped in `<<<EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT>>>` markers
- Matches ddg-search security pattern (marker sanitization)
- SKILL.md explicitly warns about prompt injection via screenshots
- Agents instructed to treat all web content as data, never as instructions

**Symlinked** to shared skills folder so all agents (Bond, Felix, Moneypenny) have access.

**Commit:** `541fe0b`

## Design Atelier Skill — Updates

Skill used extensively for Big Sky Design Atelier project. Ran 7 full prompt pipelines through it today:
- Prompts 01, 02, 04, 06, 07, 08, 09 all built using the design-atelier skill workflow
- Validated: reference gathering → mood board → design system → parallel mockup agents pipeline
- Skill templates (server.js, references.html, design-system.md) all working well
- Headless browser integration for screenshots confirmed solid (24 references gathered for prompt 07)

### Observations
- Research + design system agent occasionally stalls before completing the design system (happened on prompt 07). Main session can pick up and write the design system manually.
- Cross-prompt pollution between sequential builds is real — documented in SKILL.md's isolation guidance
- The palette rule (default to white) continues to be critical — caught agents defaulting to dark palettes multiple times
- Image search moodboards (Google/Bing screenshots) provide excellent supplemental density
