## Image Generation Skill

**Problem:** Agents often need to generate simple images (icons, placeholders, diagrams) but don't have a clear workflow for using available image generation tools.

**Scope:**
- Wrapper for image generation tools (Gemini image gen, nano-banana, DALL-E, etc.)
- Common use cases: icons, avatars, placeholder images, simple diagrams
- Output format handling (PNG, SVG, different sizes)
- Saving to project directories

**Example prompts:**
- "Generate a 128x128 app icon with a moon on dark background"
- "Create placeholder images for the design mockup"
- "Generate a simple logo for the project"

**Notes:**
- Should detect which tools are available and use them appropriately
- Handle resizing/format conversion
- Include guidance on prompt engineering for good icon results
