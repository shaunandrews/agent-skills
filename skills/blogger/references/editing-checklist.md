# Editing Checklist

A multi-pass approach to editing blog posts. Don't try to fix everything at once.

## The Five Passes

### Pass 1: Structure

**Goal:** Ensure the post flows logically and keeps readers engaged.

- [ ] Does the opening hook grab attention in the first 100 words?
- [ ] Is the main point clear early (not buried)?
- [ ] Do sections flow logically from one to the next?
- [ ] Are sections roughly balanced in length?
- [ ] Does each section earn its place? (Cut fluff sections)
- [ ] Is there a clear conclusion with a takeaway or CTA?
- [ ] Are headers descriptive and scannable?

**Common fixes:**
- Move the most important point earlier
- Merge thin sections
- Cut sections that don't serve the goal
- Add transitions between abrupt section changes

---

### Pass 2: Clarity

**Goal:** Make every sentence as clear and simple as possible.

- [ ] Can any sentence be split into two?
- [ ] Can any words be cut without losing meaning?
- [ ] Are there passive voice constructions that should be active?
- [ ] Is jargon defined or avoided?
- [ ] Are pronouns clear (does "it" or "this" have an obvious referent)?
- [ ] Are there any sentences that require re-reading?

**Red flags:**
- Sentences over 25 words
- Paragraphs over 5 sentences
- Multiple commas in one sentence
- Words ending in "-tion" (often signs of nominalization)
- "There is/are" constructions

**Common fixes:**
- Split compound sentences
- Replace complex words with simple ones
- Convert passive to active voice
- Delete hedging words (very, really, quite, somewhat)
- Delete filler phrases (in order to, due to the fact that)

### Pass 3: Voice

**Goal:** Ensure the post sounds like the blog's established voice.

- [ ] Does it match the style guide's voice characteristics?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for this content type?
- [ ] Are there any sentences that feel "off" for this blog?
- [ ] Is humor used appropriately (if applicable)?
- [ ] Are signature phrases or patterns present?
- [ ] Does it sound like a person, not a corporate entity?

**Check against style guide:**
- Review voice.md before this pass
- Compare questionable passages to exemplar posts
- Flag anything that feels generic or templated

**Common fixes:**
- Add personality to bland sentences
- Remove overly formal constructions
- Adjust humor level up or down
- Use the blog's preferred terminology

---

### Pass 4: Technical

**Goal:** Eliminate errors that undermine credibility.

- [ ] Run spell check (but don't trust it blindly)
- [ ] Check grammar (Grammarly, LanguageTool, or similar)
- [ ] Verify punctuation consistency (Oxford comma, em dashes)
- [ ] Check capitalization (especially in headers)
- [ ] Verify formatting (lists, code blocks, blockquotes)
- [ ] Check links (do they work? do they open correctly?)
- [ ] Verify image alt text is present and descriptive

**Common errors:**
- Its vs. it's
- Your vs. you're
- Their/there/they're
- Affect vs. effect
- Apostrophes in plurals
- Inconsistent capitalization in headers
- Missing periods in lists

---

### Pass 5: SEO

**Goal:** Optimize for search without sacrificing quality.

- [ ] Is the target keyword in the title?
- [ ] Is the target keyword in the URL slug?
- [ ] Is the target keyword in the first 100 words?
- [ ] Is keyword density reasonable (1-2%, not stuffed)?
- [ ] Are there related keywords and synonyms throughout?
- [ ] Is there a meta description (≤155 characters)?
- [ ] Are there internal links to related posts?
- [ ] Are there external links to credible sources?
- [ ] Are images optimized (compressed, descriptive filenames)?
- [ ] Is the content length appropriate for the keyword? (Check competitors)

See `seo-checklist.md` for detailed SEO guidance.

## Bonus Pass: Fact-Check

**Goal:** Verify all claims before publishing.

- [ ] Are all statistics from credible sources?
- [ ] Are quotes accurate and attributed?
- [ ] Are dates, names, and figures correct?
- [ ] Are technical claims accurate?
- [ ] Are there any statements that could be misinterpreted?
- [ ] Is there anything that could be defamatory or legally risky?

See `fact-checking.md` for verification workflow.

## Quick Editing Tips

### Read Aloud
Your ear catches what your eye misses. Awkward phrasing, run-on sentences, and missing words become obvious when spoken.

### Print It Out
Different medium, different perspective. Mark up a printed copy with a pen.

### Read Backwards
Start from the last paragraph and work up. Breaks the flow, forces focus on each paragraph in isolation.

### Sleep On It
Fresh eyes are better eyes. If deadline allows, edit tomorrow.

### Use Text-to-Speech
Have the computer read it to you. Catches different issues than reading aloud yourself.

### Cut 10%
After you think you're done, challenge yourself to cut 10% more. Almost always possible.

## Editing Symbols

When marking up drafts (printed or annotated):

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ~~strikethrough~~ | Delete |

## When to Stop Editing

Editing has diminishing returns. Stop when:
- You're making changes, then changing them back
- You've done all five passes
- The deadline requires it
- You're second-guessing things that were fine

Perfect is the enemy of published. Ship it.
