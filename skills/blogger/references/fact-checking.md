# Fact-Checking Guide

Verify claims before publishing. Your credibility is on the line.

---

## Why Fact-Check?

- **Credibility** — One wrong fact undermines everything else
- **Legal risk** — False claims can be defamatory
- **Trust** — Readers remember who gets it wrong
- **SEO** — Google rewards accurate, trustworthy content (E-E-A-T)

## Types of Claims

### Verifiable Facts

Can be checked against authoritative sources.

**Examples:**
- Statistics and numbers
- Dates and timelines
- Quotes and attributions
- Technical specifications
- Legal/regulatory information
- Scientific claims

**Action:** Verify before publishing.

### Opinions

Clearly framed as perspective, not fact.

**Examples:**
- "I think..."
- "In my experience..."
- "The best approach, in my opinion..."

**Action:** Ensure they're clearly marked as opinion. No verification needed.

### Analysis/Interpretation

Drawing conclusions from facts.

**Examples:**
- "This data suggests..."
- "Based on these numbers, we can conclude..."

**Action:** Verify the underlying facts. Ensure interpretation is reasonable.

### Unverified Statements

Stated as fact but lacking source.

**Examples:**
- "Studies show that..." (which studies?)
- "Experts agree..." (which experts?)
- "Most people..." (citation needed)

**Action:** Either find a source, add attribution, or reframe as opinion.

## Verification Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Claims

Read through the draft and list all factual claims:

```
[ ] "WordPress powers 43% of the web"
[ ] "The average blog post takes 4 hours to write"
[ ] "Google processes 8.5 billion searches per day"
[ ] "Einstein said '...'"
```

### Step 2: Categorize by Risk

**High risk:** Statistics, quotes, legal claims, medical/health info, financial data
**Medium risk:** Historical facts, technical specifications, company information
**Lower risk:** General knowledge, widely accepted facts

Focus verification effort on high-risk claims first.

### Step 3: Find Primary Sources

**Primary source:** The original publisher of the information.

**Secondary source:** Someone reporting/citing the primary source.

**Always prefer primary sources:**
- ❌ "According to a blog post that mentioned a study..."
- ✅ "According to the study published in [Journal]..."

### Step 4: Verify and Document

For each claim:
1. Find the source
2. Confirm accuracy
3. Check date (is it current?)
4. Note the source for citation

## Finding Reliable Sources

### Generally Reliable

- **Government sources:** .gov sites, census data, regulatory agencies
- **Academic sources:** Peer-reviewed journals, university research
- **Primary research:** Original studies, official reports
- **Official company data:** Press releases, annual reports, documentation
- **Major news organizations:** With editorial standards and corrections policies

### Use with Caution

- **Wikipedia:** Good starting point, but verify via its citations
- **Industry reports:** Check who funded the research
- **Surveys:** Check sample size, methodology, who conducted it
- **Social media:** Only for confirming what someone said, not facts

### Generally Unreliable

- **Anonymous sources:** Unless corroborated
- **Outdated information:** Especially for stats, tech, prices
- **Single-source claims:** If only one outlet reports it, be skeptical
- **Obvious bias:** Advocacy sites presenting opinion as fact
- **AI-generated content:** Known to hallucinate facts

## Common Verification Challenges

### Statistics

**Check:**
- Who conducted the study?
- When was it conducted?
- What was the sample size?
- What was the methodology?
- Is it being cited correctly?

**Red flags:**
- No source cited
- Source is a blog citing another blog
- Very old data presented as current
- Suspiciously round numbers
- Data that seems too good to be true

**Example verification:**
- Claim: "73% of marketers say content marketing works"
- Find: The original survey, conducted by [Organization] in [Year]
- Verify: Sample size, exact wording, full context
- Update: If survey is old, find more recent data

### Quotes

**Check:**
- Did the person actually say this?
- Is it in the correct context?
- Is it the full quote (not selectively edited)?

**Red flags:**
- No original source
- Quote sounds too perfect for your point
- Famous person, suspiciously fitting quote

**Tools:**
- Google the exact quote in quotation marks
- Check Quote Investigator for famous quotes
- Find video/audio/transcript for recent quotes

### "Everyone Knows" Claims

**Watch for:**
- "Studies show..." (which studies?)
- "Experts agree..." (which experts?)
- "Research suggests..." (what research?)
- "It's well known that..." (citation needed)

**Fix by:**
- Finding the actual source
- Removing the claim
- Reframing as your opinion
- Adding appropriate hedging

## Special Cases

### Legal Claims

"This is legal" or "This is illegal" — Always verify with:
- Official legal text (laws, regulations)
- Jurisdiction-specific (laws vary by location)

**When in doubt:** Add "consult a lawyer" disclaimer or remove the claim.

### Medical/Health Claims

Extra scrutiny required. Misinformation can harm people.

- Verify with peer-reviewed medical sources
- Check medical organization guidelines
- Note that individual experiences vary
- Include disclaimers when appropriate

### Financial Claims

"You can make $X" or "This investment will..."

- Verify any income/return claims
- Note that results vary
- Check regulatory requirements for disclaimers
- Be especially careful with "guaranteed" anything
