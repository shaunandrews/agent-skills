# Writing Guide

Best practices for blog writing that engages readers and ranks well.

---

## Post Structure

### The Hook (First 100 Words)

Your opening must grab attention immediately. Readers decide in seconds whether to continue.

**Effective hooks:**
- **Problem statement** — "You've tried every productivity app, and you're still drowning in tasks."
- **Surprising fact** — "The average blog post takes 4 hours to write. Mine take 45 minutes."
- **Question** — "What if everything you know about SEO is wrong?"
- **Story snippet** — "Last Tuesday, my server caught fire. Not metaphorically."
- **Contrarian take** — "Forget everything you've read about morning routines."

**Avoid:**
- Generic introductions ("In this post, I will discuss...")
- Throat-clearing ("Before we begin, let me explain...")
- Dictionary definitions ("According to Webster's...")

### Body Structure

**Ideal flow:**
1. Hook → 2. Context → 3. Main points → 4. Supporting evidence → 5. Conclusion + CTA

**Scannable formatting:**
- Headers every 300 words (H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bullet/numbered lists for series of items
- Bold key phrases (sparingly)
- Pull quotes for emphasis

**Section balance:**
- Each main section should be roughly equal length
- Don't front-load all the good stuff
- Save a strong point for near the end

### The Conclusion

Weak conclusions kill otherwise good posts.

**Strong conclusions:**
- Summarize the key takeaway (one sentence)
- Provide a clear next step or CTA
- End with something memorable (callback to hook, future promise, question)

**Avoid:**
- "In conclusion..." (just conclude)
- Introducing new information
- Trailing off without resolution

## Writing Style

### Clarity First

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." — Einstein (maybe)

**Rules:**
- One idea per sentence
- One topic per paragraph
- Cut every word that doesn't earn its place

**Before:** "It is important to note that the process of writing blog posts can be significantly improved through the implementation of a structured approach."

**After:** "A structured approach makes writing easier."

### Active Voice

Passive voice weakens writing. Use it sparingly and intentionally.

**Passive:** "The post was written by Sarah."
**Active:** "Sarah wrote the post."

**Passive:** "Mistakes were made."
**Active:** "I made mistakes." (or "We screwed up.")

**When passive is OK:**
- The actor is unknown: "The server was compromised."
- The action matters more than the actor: "The bill was passed unanimously."

### Sentence Variety

Mix sentence lengths for rhythm:

> Short sentences punch. They create emphasis. But too many in a row feel choppy and breathless, like you're running out of air. So vary them. Longer sentences with multiple clauses give readers a chance to breathe, to settle into the flow of your argument, to follow a more complex thought to its conclusion. Then hit them with a short one. Like this.

### Word Choice

**Prefer:**
- Common words over fancy ones
- Specific over vague
- Verbs over nouns (especially nominalization)
- Concrete over abstract

**Weak:** "The utilization of the application facilitated productivity enhancement."
**Strong:** "The app helped me get more done."

### Contractions

Use them. They sound natural.

**Stiff:** "I do not think this is the right approach."
**Natural:** "I don't think this is the right approach."

Unless your style guide specifies formality, contractions make writing feel human.

## Readability

### Target Reading Level

- **General audience:** Grade 6-8 (Flesch-Kincaid)
- **Technical audience:** Grade 10-12
- **Everyone benefits from simpler writing**

### Flesch Reading Ease Scores

| Score | Difficulty | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 90-100 | Very Easy | Children's books |
| 80-89 | Easy | Conversational |
| 70-79 | Fairly Easy | Most blogs |
| 60-69 | Standard | News articles |
| 50-59 | Fairly Hard | Academic papers |
| 30-49 | Difficult | Technical docs |
| 0-29 | Very Hard | Legal documents |

**Aim for 60-80 for most blog content.**

### Quick Readability Fixes

1. **Break long sentences** — If it has multiple commas, consider splitting
2. **Replace complex words** — "utilize" → "use", "implement" → "do"
3. **Cut filler phrases** — "in order to" → "to", "due to the fact that" → "because"
4. **Shorten paragraphs** — Max 4 sentences, often 2-3 is better
5. **Use lists** — Series of items are clearer as bullets

## Tone Adaptation

Your voice stays consistent, but tone shifts based on:

### Content Type

| Type | Tone Adjustment |
|------|-----------------|
| Tutorial | Patient, step-by-step, encouraging |
| Opinion | Confident, direct, personal |
| News/Announcement | Clear, factual, efficient |
| Story/Experience | Warm, narrative, reflective |
| Listicle | Snappy, scannable, punchy |

### Audience State

| Reader Feeling | Tone Adjustment |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Confused | Simple, reassuring, no jargon |
| Frustrated | Empathetic, solution-focused |
| Excited | Match energy, celebrate |
| Skeptical | Evidence-heavy, measured |
| Bored | Hook harder, get to point faster |

### Sensitive Topics

When covering difficult subjects:
- Lead with empathy
- Acknowledge complexity
- Avoid false equivalence
- Be accurate without being sensational

## Common Mistakes

### Weak Openings
❌ "In this article, we will explore..."
❌ "Have you ever wondered..."
❌ "Let's dive in!"
✅ Start with the actual content

### Buried Lede
Don't save the main point for paragraph 5. Put it in paragraph 1.

### Over-Hedging
❌ "I think that maybe this could possibly work..."
✅ "This works." (add caveats later if needed)

### Repetition
- Don't repeat the headline in the first sentence
- Vary word choice (thesaurus sparingly)
- Read aloud to catch repeated phrases

### Jargon
Unless writing for experts:
- Define terms on first use
- Prefer common synonyms
- Link to glossaries for complex concepts

## Writing Process

### Before Writing

1. **Define the goal** — What should readers do/know/feel after?
2. **Know your audience** — Who is this for? What do they already know?
3. **Research** — Gather facts, stats, examples
4. **Outline** — Structure before prose

### During Writing

1. **Write the body first** — Intro and conclusion are easier once you know the content
2. **Don't edit while drafting** — Get it down, then refine
3. **Use placeholders** — [NEED STAT], [ADD EXAMPLE], [LINK TO X]
4. **Take breaks** — Fresh eyes catch more issues

### After Writing

1. **Let it sit** — At least an hour, ideally overnight
2. **Edit in passes** — Structure → Clarity → Voice → Technical → SEO
3. **Read aloud** — Catches awkward phrasing
4. **Get feedback** — Fresh perspective helps
